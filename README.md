MobaLinux
=========
The whole point of this project is to try to get Mobalytics running directly on linux.
This should help both with performance as well as logging in (Looking into adding a protocol handler).

The main goal is to just wrap and re-package the app, however as the code isn't minified, it may be possible to patch
certain files.
